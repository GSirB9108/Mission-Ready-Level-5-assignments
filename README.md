This is a collection of mini assignments/ code challenges I worked on as part of Mission Ready’s level 5 advanced software development programme. 
The technologies used and main programming frameworks are JavaScript (React JS for frontend, Express/ Node JS for backend) as well as supplemental NPM packages and external tools as specified in each project description.

1. ‘IBM Watson chatbot’ is an implementation of the IBM Watson chatbot within a HTML page, in the context of a car insurance business.

2. ‘IBM Watson document search’ is a full stack application that takes in a query through the client and sends it to the server to analyse whether it can return a relevant result related to the submitted query in the context of car insurance. For example, typing “car breakdown” would return a paragraph detailing the policy in the event of a car breakdown. 

This project also features unit testing of a function that removes non-letter characters at the beginning of the search (e.g: “!Hello World” becomes “Hello World”) before sending the user submitted phrase to the backend using CodeCov, as well as automated deployment to Azure web services in terms of DevOps.

3. ‘Turners UX design implementation’ is the result of building a react client side application following a UX design figma, given by fellow students in the Mission Ready course studying UX design.

This project also features static code analysis using SonarQube as well as automated deployment to Azure web services in terms of DevOps.

4. ‘Contact form with mongoDB’ is a full stack application that features a contact form for the frontend alongside a server backend building with Express/ Node JS connected to a mongoDB database. 

The whole tech stack is also containerised within a single docker-compose multi-container.

5. 'Property search UX design implementation' is the result of building a react client side application following a UX design figma, given by fellow students in the Mission Ready course studying UX design.

This project features the use of the Mapbox API within React as part of the prototype of the geolocation search function that was part of the UX design.
